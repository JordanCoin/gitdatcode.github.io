# #DatCode | a coding community
## this is a repository for DatCode's portal to the world. (the website.)

Anyone from the community can contribute! Make sure your changes are well documented, and make sure you follow the guidelines as to keep the code clean and readable.

### version 1.0
This is the initial version. Just a one page site, giving insight to the three pillars of DatCode:
* sharing
* collaboration
* conversation

...and a contact section at the bottom.
    
### new features
We'll keep a running list of features we'd like to add to the site.
- [ ] calendar (to be used for events)
- [ ] newsletter sign-up (tentative; should we decide to make one)


### coding guidelines
A more thorough set of coding guidelines soon come. For starters:
* keep it neat and readable. That means use your tabs.
* use nouns so it's easier to read and we can follow what it is you're doing.
* use comments liberally. Too many comments are never a bad thing.
* if you'd like, mark your work with your name/tag, so other contributors can refer back if they have questions.
