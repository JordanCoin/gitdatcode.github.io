# #DatCode | a coding community
## this is a repository for DatCode's portal to the world. (the website.)

Anyone from the community can contribute! Make sure your changes are well documented, and make sure you follow the guidelines as to keep the code clean and readable.
    
### coding guidelines
A more thorough set of coding guidelines soon come. For starters:
* keep it neat and readable. That means use your tabs.
* use nouns so it's easier to read and we can follow what it is you're doing.
* use comments liberally. Too many comments are never a bad thing.
* if you'd like, mark your work with your name/tag, so other contributors can refer back if they have questions.

### new features
We'll keep a running list of features we'd like to add to the site.
- [ ] calendar (to be used for events)
- [ ] newsletter sign-up (tentative; should we decide to make one)
- [ ] ticker for number of Slack members, #DatCode mentions on Twitter and Facebook

### components (as of v1.0):
* [Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com)
* [FontAwesome](http://www.fontawesome.io) for the icons
* [JQuery](http://www.jquery.org) (Bootstrap dependency for navbar collapse)
* [Less](http://www.lesscss.org) because using LESS for CSS is so much better
* script.js has a script for the in-page links (scrolling to the section on the page) 

### version 1.0
This is the initial version. Just a one page site, divied up into a "Why?", "What?" and "How?"
* The "Why?" - why are we doing this?
* The "What?" - okay so what are y'all doing?
* The "How?" - aite I'm interested, how do I join?

Pretty simple stuff. We can expand as it gets larger and parts start moving.
